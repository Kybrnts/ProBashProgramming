Question: 
  What potential problem exists with the following snippet?

  year=$( date +%Y )
  month=$( date +%m )
  day=$( date +%d )
  hour=$( date +%H )
  minute=$( date +%M )
  second=$( date +%S )

Quote: 
  "If teh command substitution is not quoted, word splitting and pathname expansion are performed on the results."

Answer:
  Therefore the potential problem may be the result of undesired subsecuent word splitting and pathname expansion of
  proposed command substitutions.
  A better example would be to contrast the execution of the following two sinppets:
  # echo $( echo './*' )
  # echo "$( echo './*' )"
