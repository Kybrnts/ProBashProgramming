Question: 
  What potential problem exists with the following snippet?

  year=$( date +%Y )
  month=$( date +%m )
  day=$( date +%d )
  hour=$( date +%H )
  minute=$( date +%M )
  second=$( date +%S )

Quotes:
  1. "Well, it is not exactly the same, because I ran the first command shortly before midnight and the second sortly
      after"
  2. "If teh command substitution is not quoted, word splitting and pathname expansion are performed on the results."

Answer:
  Firstly, there seems to be an efficiency issue, since that way we are issuing date several times.
  In addition, as per above first statement there is a big potential issue if above snippet is issued by a script that
  runs close enough to midnight.
  Finally, as per the second statement, an additional potential problem may be the result of undesired subsecuent word
  splitting and pathname expansion of proposed command substitutions.
  A better example would be to contrast the execution of the following two sinppets:
  # echo $( echo './*' )
  # echo "$( echo './*' )"

  We recommend using something like this instead:
  read year month day hour minute second < <( date +'%Y %m %d %H %M %S' )
